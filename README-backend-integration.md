# Backend Integration Setup

This document describes how to set up the frontend to work with the Modality-Fit backend.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the react-website directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Backend API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `Modality-Fit-Backend` directory
2. Follow the setup instructions in the backend README
3. Ensure the backend is running on port 8000
4. The frontend will automatically connect to the backend endpoints

## Available Endpoints

The frontend is now integrated with the following backend endpoints:

### Virtual Try-On
- **GPT-4o Try-On**: `/api/gpt/tryon-generate-model` - Advanced AI-generated model try-on
- **Kling Try-On**: `/api/kling/try-on` - Traditional virtual try-on with async processing

### File Upload
- **S3 Upload**: `/api/s3/upload` - Upload user images to S3 storage

### Video Generation
- **VEO Fashion Video**: `/api/veo/fashion-video` - Generate fashion videos

## How It Works

1. **Upload Images**: Users can upload clothing images which are automatically uploaded to S3
2. **Drag & Drop**: Images can be dragged from the gallery to table cells
3. **Generate**: The Generate button triggers backend API calls for virtual try-on
4. **Results**: Generated images are displayed in the Results column
5. **Export**: The Export ZIP button downloads all generated results as a zip file
6. **Loading States**: UI shows loading indicators and progress during generation
7. **Error Handling**: Any errors are displayed with user-friendly messages

## Features Implemented

- ✅ Image upload to S3 with progress indicators
- ✅ Integration with GPT-4o virtual try-on endpoint
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Result display in table format
- ✅ Individual row generation
- ✅ Bulk generation for all rows
- ✅ Export all results as ZIP file with progress indicators
- ⏳ Kling async try-on with polling (partially implemented)
- ⏳ VEO video generation integration (API ready, UI pending)

## Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. Add polling mechanism for Kling async operations
2. Integrate VEO video generation with UI
3. Implement batch operations
4. Add result history and management
5. Add result preview/zoom functionality
6. Implement result filtering and search
